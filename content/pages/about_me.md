Title: About me
Slug: about-me
Lang: en

I am Oscar Triano 'dotoscat' and I am
`new Date().getYear() - new Date(1987,  10, 5).getYear()` years old

I am curious and I like to learn new things. I believe that programming must be fun.
I write code for humans beings. Machines are our slaves...

You can see what am I working on [here](https://github.com/dotoscat).
