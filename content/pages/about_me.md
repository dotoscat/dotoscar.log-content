Title: About me

I am Oscar Triano 'dotoscat' and I am
`new Date().getYear() - new Date(1987,  10, 5).getYear()` years old

I am curious and I like to try and learn new things. I believe that programming must be fun.
I write code for humans beings. So, my mainly programming language is Python.
Machines are our slaves!
